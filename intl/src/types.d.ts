/**
 * Given a message getter of type `T` (which may be a union of multiple message
 * types), return a combined type representing the intersection of all values
 * needed to satisfy the mix of values.
 *
 * For example, given a variable representing one of two message getters, where
 * one requires a single value to be formatted, but the other requires an
 * additional value on top of that one:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // message1: "Hello {username}"
 * // message2: "Hello {username}, it's {currentDate, date}"
 * const message = someCondition ? message1 || message2;
 * ```
 *
 * Attempting to format this message would require that both `username` _and_
 * `currentDate` are supplied, so that all possible cases are covered, which is
 * what this type resolves:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * type ResolvedValuesTypes = FormatValuesFor<typeof message>;
 * // => {username: string, currentDate: Date}
 * ```
 *
 * This values type can then be used to enforce that all values are passed to
 * functions that format the message, like `i18n.format`:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * declare function format<T>(message: T, values: FormatValuesFor<T>): string;
 * ```
 *
 * ## Mixed message types
 *
 * If T is a union of message types including both rich messages requiring
 * values _and_ plain string messages with no values, this type will still
 * properly resolve all of the required values, assuming that the getters for
 * the plain messages use the convention of passing `undefined` as the generic
 * argument, representing "no values should be passed for this message".
 *
 *
 * ## Why this type?
 *
 * All "messages" are really defined as functions that return a specific
 * value of the message for a requested locale, `(locale: string) => Message`.
 * This is named `TypedIntlMessageGetter<T>`, where `T` is the definition of
 * the values required to format the message.
 *
 * This type requires being passed the entire getter function rather than the
 * returned message types, as narrowing to the returned type prevents
 * TypeScript from distributing the union properly. This surfaces as error
 * messages showing up on the _message_ type rather than the _value_ type when
 * they don't match, which doesn't give the user any helpful information about
 * what's wrong. This method ensures the value type is always the one being
 * checked against the provided message types, and error messages will be
 * accurate as a result.

/**
 * A type representing any message that has been formatted using one of the
 * default formatting methods in the `@discord/intl` system. Use this type
 * when you don't care about whether a message is static or contains rich text
 * or has dynamically-formatted values, when you need to handle both in tandem,
 * or when you need a generic return type for a function returning "any
 * any-already formatted message".
 *
 * Generally, this is like `React.ReactNode`, accepting both strings and rich
 * `ReactElement`s, but it is more specific to disallow nullish values and
 * other special React elements like `ReactPortal`. Seeing this type, you can
 * be confident that the value is intended to be the result of formatting an
 * intl message, even if the actual value comes from elsewhere (like a
 * user-generated string).

 *
 * ASTs are created _after_ all placeholders have been filled by values
 * from a call to `formatToParts`, meaning they are intended to be fully static
 * structures passed around for custom rendering functions to use.

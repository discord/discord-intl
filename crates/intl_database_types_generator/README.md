# intl_database_types_generator

Database services for generating TypeScript definition files mapping from a single `SourceFile`. Types are created by analyzing both definitions _and_ translations to create comprehensive types that represent all possibilities for a message and ensure content isn't missed or supplied incorrectly.

This is a library crate that is only built as part of another crate.
